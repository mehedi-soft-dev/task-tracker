# Frontend Implementation Phases

## Phase 1: Project Setup & Core Configuration
**Goal:** Establish the foundation with proper tooling and configuration

### Tasks:
- [ ] Create React application with TypeScript
- [ ] Configure professional folder structure
- [ ] Install production dependencies (React, React-DOM, TypeScript)
- [ ] Install development dependencies (testing, linting, formatting tools)
- [ ] Configure TypeScript (tsconfig.json with strict mode, path aliases)
- [ ] Configure ESLint rules
- [ ] Set up Prettier formatting
- [ ] Configure pre-commit hooks (Husky)
- [ ] Set up environment variables (.env files)
- [ ] Create basic README with setup instructions

**Deliverable:** Working React TypeScript project with proper development environment

## Phase 2: GraphQL/Relay Infrastructure
**Goal:** Set up complete GraphQL/Relay integration with backend

### Tasks:
- [ ] Install Relay dependencies (react-relay, relay-runtime, relay-compiler)
- [ ] Install GraphQL dependencies
- [ ] Configure relay.config.js
- [ ] Download GraphQL schema from backend
- [ ] Implement relay/environment.ts (network layer, store, caching)
- [ ] Create relay/config.ts for configuration
- [ ] Set up GraphQL fragments (TaskFragment)
- [ ] Create GraphQL queries (GetAllTasksQuery, GetTaskByIdQuery)
- [ ] Create GraphQL mutations (CreateTask, UpdateTaskStatus, UpdateTask)
- [ ] Configure Relay compiler in package.json scripts
- [ ] Test GraphQL connection with backend

**Deliverable:** Working Relay environment connected to backend GraphQL API

---

## Phase 3: Component Architecture & UI Foundation
**Goal:** Build the core UI components and layout structure

### Tasks:
- [ ] Install Adobe React Spectrum and icons
- [ ] Configure React Spectrum theme provider
- [ ] Create layout/AppLayout component
- [ ] Create layout/PageHeader component
- [ ] Create common/LoadingSpinner component
- [ ] Create common/ErrorBoundary component
- [ ] Create common/ErrorMessage component
- [ ] Create common/EmptyState component
- [ ] Create styles/global.css and variables.css
- [ ] Set up responsive design system
- [ ] Create basic routing structure (if needed)

**Deliverable:** Complete UI foundation with React Spectrum integrated

---

## Phase 4: Core Task Features
**Goal:** Implement all task-related functionality

### Tasks:
- [ ] Create containers/TaskListContainer with Relay
- [ ] Create features/tasks/TaskList component
- [ ] Create features/tasks/TaskItem component
- [ ] Create features/tasks/AddTaskForm component
- [ ] Create features/tasks/TaskStatusToggle component
- [ ] Create features/tasks/TaskFilters component
- [ ] Implement pagination for task list
- [ ] Implement optimistic updates for mutations
- [ ] Add loading states and skeletons
- [ ] Handle error states properly
- [ ] Test CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update)

**Deliverable:** Fully functional task management system

---

## Phase 5: State Management & Services
**Goal:** Add proper state management and utility services

### Tasks:
- [ ] Create contexts/ThemeContext (light/dark mode)
- [ ] Create contexts/NotificationContext (toast notifications)
- [ ] Create custom hooks (useDebounce, useLocalStorage, etc.)
- [ ] Create hooks/useTaskMutations (encapsulate mutations)
- [ ] Create hooks/useTaskQueries (encapsulate queries)
- [ ] Create services/api.ts (HTTP abstraction)
- [ ] Create services/storage.ts (localStorage wrapper)
- [ ] Create services/validation.ts (form validation)
- [ ] Create services/formatter.ts (date/string formatting)
- [ ] Create utils/constants.ts and helpers.ts

**Deliverable:** Organized state management and reusable services

---

## Phase 6: Polish & Optimization
**Goal:** Optimize performance, add testing, and polish the application

### Tasks:
- [ ] Write unit tests for utilities and hooks
- [ ] Write component tests for main features
- [ ] Write integration tests for task flows
- [ ] Implement code splitting and lazy loading
- [ ] Optimize React components (React.memo, useMemo, useCallback)
- [ ] Optimize Relay queries (batching, proper pagination)
- [ ] Add accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- [ ] Implement error logging service
- [ ] Add performance monitoring
- [ ] Create production build configuration
- [ ] Complete documentation
- [ ] Final testing and bug fixes

**Deliverable:** Production-ready, optimized, and tested application
